/**
 * Utility functions of the core module
 * This file exports the utility functions of the module
 */

// Utility functions will be implemented and exported here as
// the system is progressively implemented

// Commented out re-exports as their contents are unused according to ts-prune
// export * from './diff';
export * from './history'; // Keep as history utils might be used elsewhere
// export * from './id';
export * from './validation'; // Restore export as validation functions are used directly

// Note: getValueAtPath was listed by ts-prune but its source is unclear from the index file.
